Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
V1.0

I hope to extend this asset in future and provide more significant documentation 
but until then if you require any assistance or have any suggestions for improvements, 
please email me at robert.wells@gandhigames.co.uk 
and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

I have included a simple test scene that creates an ANN, provides it with random input each time-step and prints the output (see ANNTest script). 
Not a very useful application but it shows you how the neural network could be setup.
